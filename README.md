# About
We’re back again for the Fall/Winter 2021-22 session with a new team of executives and we’re Lassonde’s Biggest Computer club. Our goal is to unite all Computer Science, Computer Security, Software Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Digital Media and Non-Computer Science majors to form a community of people who love to code as well as have fun by participating in workshops and chill nights.
